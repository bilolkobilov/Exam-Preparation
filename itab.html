                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li><strong>Bus Topology:</strong> A simple topology where all devices are connected to a single cable, called the bus.  Data is transmitted along the bus, and each device checks the destination address to see if it should receive the data.  Bus topologies are easy to implement but can be slow and unreliable if the bus cable fails.</li>
                        <li><strong>Star Topology:</strong> A topology where all devices are connected to a central hub or switch.  Data is transmitted from the sending device to the hub, which then forwards it to the intended recipient.

                        <li><strong>Ring Topology:</strong> A topology where devices are connected in a closed loop, with each device connected to two other devices.  Data travels around the ring in one direction.  Ring topologies can be efficient but a failure in any device or cable can disrupt the entire network.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mesh Topology:</strong> A topology where each device is connected to every other device in the network.  Mesh topologies provide high reliability and redundancy, as there are multiple paths for data to travel.  However, they are complex and expensive to implement, especially for large networks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hybrid Topology:</strong> A combination of two or more different topologies.  For example, a network might combine a star topology for individual departments with a bus topology to connect the departments.  Hybrid topologies offer flexibility and can be tailored to the specific needs of an organization.</li>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">10. Domain Name System (DNS)</h3>
                
                    <p><strong>Domain Name System (DNS):</strong> A hierarchical and distributed naming system that translates human-readable domain names, such as "google.com," into numerical IP addresses, such as "172.217.160.142," which computers use to identify and communicate with each other on the internet.</p>
                    <p><strong>How DNS Works:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li>Users enter domain names (e.g., google.com) into their web browsers or applications.</li>
                        <li>DNS resolvers, typically provided by internet service providers (ISPs), query DNS servers to find the IP address associated with the domain name.</li>
                        <li>DNS servers, organized in a hierarchical structure, store and manage domain name-to-IP address mappings.  The process involves querying root servers, top-level domain (TLD) servers (e.g., .com, .org), and authoritative name servers.</li>
                        <li>Once the IP address is found, it is returned to the user's browser or application, allowing the device to connect to the corresponding web server.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Related Concepts:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li><strong>IP Addresses:</strong> Numerical labels assigned to each device on a network, enabling them to communicate with each other.  There are two versions: IPv4 (32-bit addresses) and IPv6 (128-bit addresses).</li>
                        <li><strong>Domain Registration:</strong> The process of reserving a unique domain name through a domain name registrar.  This allows individuals and organizations to establish an online identity and create a website with a memorable address.</li>
                        <li><strong>URL Structure:</strong> The format of web addresses, which consists of several parts, including the protocol (e.g., https://), the domain name (e.g., www.example.com), and the path to a specific resource (e.g., /page).</li>
                    </ul>
                

                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">11. Internet Protocols & Addressing</h3>
                
                    <p><strong>IP Addressing:</strong> The system of assigning numerical labels (IP addresses) to devices on a network to enable them to communicate with each other.  There are two main versions of IP addressing:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li><strong>IPv4:</strong> The original 32-bit address format, which provides approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.  Due to the rapid growth of the internet, IPv4 addresses are now largely exhausted.</li>
                        <li><strong>IPv6:</strong> A newer 128-bit address format designed to replace IPv4, providing a vastly larger address space (approximately 340 undecillion addresses).  IPv6 offers improved security and routing capabilities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Networking Protocols:</strong> A set of rules that govern how data is transmitted and received over a network.  Key protocols include:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</strong> The foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, used to transfer hypertext documents (web pages) between web servers and browsers.</li>
                        <li><strong>HTTPS (Secure HTTP):</strong> A secure version of HTTP that encrypts data transmission using SSL/TLS protocols, protecting sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers.</li>
                        <li><strong>FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</strong> A protocol used to transfer files between computers over a network, commonly used for uploading and downloading files from web servers.</li>
                        <li><strong>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):</strong> The fundamental suite of protocols that govern communication on the internet.  TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data, while IP handles addressing and routing of data packets.</li>
                        <li><strong>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):</strong> The standard protocol for sending emails between mail servers.</li>
                        <li><strong>POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3):</strong> A protocol used by email clients to retrieve emails from a mail server.  POP3 downloads emails to the client's device and typically deletes them from the server.</li>
                        <li><strong>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):</strong> A more advanced protocol for retrieving emails, allowing users to access and manage emails on the server without downloading them to their device.  IMAP supports features like folder management and synchronization across multiple devices.</li>
                    </ul>
