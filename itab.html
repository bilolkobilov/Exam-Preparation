                <p>
                    <strong>Computer software</strong> comprises the set of instructions, data, or programs that a computer uses to operate and perform specific tasks. It's the non-tangible component of a computer system, contrasting with the physical hardware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Software is broadly categorized into two types:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>System Software:</strong> This category includes programs that manage and integrate computer hardware and provide an environment for application software to run.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Operating Systems (OS):</strong> The most fundamental system software, managing hardware resources and providing services like memory management, process scheduling, and input/output control.
                                <p>Example: Windows 10, macOS Monterey, Ubuntu Linux.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Device Drivers:</strong> Software that enables communication between the OS and specific hardware devices.
                                <p>Example: Printer drivers, graphics card drivers, USB drivers.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Utility Programs:</strong> Tools that perform specific tasks related to system management, maintenance, or optimization.
                                 <p>Example: Disk defragmenters, antivirus software, file compression tools.</p>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Software:</strong>  This category includes programs designed to perform specific tasks for the user, addressing their needs.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Productivity Software:</strong> Applications used for creating documents, presentations, spreadsheets, etc.
                                <p>Example: Microsoft Office Suite (Word, PowerPoint, Excel), Google Workspace.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Communication Software:</strong> Applications that enable communication and collaboration.
                                <p>Example: Email clients (Outlook, Gmail), video conferencing tools (Zoom, Microsoft Teams).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Entertainment Software:</strong> Applications for leisure and enjoyment.
                                <p>Example: Video games, media players (VLC), streaming services (Netflix).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Business Software:</strong> Applications designed for specific business functions.
                                <p>Example: Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.</p>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Interaction between Hardware and Software:</strong>
                    Software provides the instructions that dictate how hardware should function.  The hardware carries out these instructions to perform desired operations.  For instance, when you open a web browser (software), the OS (software) instructs the CPU (hardware) to allocate memory and process the browser's code.  The browser then sends signals to the network interface card (hardware) to retrieve data from the internet.  The monitor (hardware) displays the retrieved information, guided by the graphics card (hardware) and its driver (software).
                </p>

                    <strong>Computer storage</strong> refers to the technologies and devices used to retain digital data.  Storage is classified by its accessibility, speed, cost, and volatility.
                </p>

                <p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Storage (Main Memory):</strong> This is the computer's working memory, providing fast access to data that the CPU is currently using.  It is essential for the execution of programs.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong>
                                <ul>
                                     <li>Volatile memory; data is lost when the power is turned off.</li>
                                     <li>Used to store data and instructions that the CPU actively needs.</li>
                                     <li>Faster access speed compared to secondary storage.</li>

                <p>
                    The <strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong> is the core of a computer system, responsible for executing instructions and processing data. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, executes them, and writes the results back to memory.  It is the "brain" of the computer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Components of the CPU:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Control Unit (CU):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Directs and coordinates all CPU operations.</li>
                            <li>Fetches instructions from main memory.</li>
                            <li>Decodes the instructions (interprets what the instruction is).</li>
                            <li>Controls the flow of data within the CPU.</li>
                            <li>Sends control signals to other components, such as the ALU and registers, to execute instructions.</li>
                            <li>It acts like a manager, ensuring that instructions are executed in the correct sequence.</li>
                            <li>Example:  The CU fetches an instruction like "ADD A, B, C" from memory, decodes it to understand it means "add the values in registers A and B and store the result in register C", and then signals the ALU to perform the addition.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Performs all arithmetic and logical operations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Arithmetic Operations:</strong> Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.</li>
                            <li><strong>Logical Operations:</strong> AND, OR, NOT, comparisons (equal to, greater than, less than).</li>
                            <li>The CU sends the data and the operation to be performed to the ALU.</li>
                            <li>The ALU performs the operation and sends the result back to the CU.</li>
                            <li>Example: If the instruction is "ADD A, B, C", the ALU adds the values in registers A and B and sends the sum to the CU.  If the instruction is "IF A > B", the ALU compares the values in A and B and sends a true/false value to the CU.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Registers:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU.</li>
                            <li>Used to hold data and instructions that the CPU is currently working on.</li>
                            <li>Provide very fast access to data, significantly faster than accessing main memory.</li>
                            <li>Types of Registers:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Instruction Register (IR):</strong> Holds the current instruction being executed.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Program Counter (PC):</strong> Holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Memory Address Register (MAR):</strong> Holds the address of the memory location being accessed.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Memory Data Register (MDR):</strong> Holds the data being read from or written to memory.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Accumulator (AC):</strong> Holds the intermediate results of calculations.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Example:  When the CPU is adding two numbers, the numbers might be temporarily stored in registers before being sent to the ALU, and the result might be stored in another register.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cache Memory:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A small, fast memory located between the CPU and main memory.</li>
                            <li>Stores frequently accessed data and instructions.</li>
                            <li>Reduces the average time it takes the CPU to access memory.</li>
                            <li>Works on the principle of locality of reference (data that has been accessed recently is likely to be accessed again soon).</li>
                            <li>Levels of Cache: L1, L2, L3 (L1 is the fastest and smallest, L3 is the slowest and largest).</li>
                            <li>Example:  If the CPU repeatedly needs the same data, it will be stored in the cache.  The CPU can then access it from the cache much faster than from main memory.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Fetch:</strong> The Control Unit fetches the next instruction from main memory. The address of the next instruction is in the Program Counter (PC). The instruction is loaded into the Instruction Register (IR).  The PC is incremented to point to the next instruction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decode:</strong> The Control Unit decodes the instruction in the Instruction Register (IR) to determine what operation needs to be performed and what data is needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Execute:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Control Unit sends signals to the ALU and registers to perform the operation.</li>
                            <li>If the instruction involves data in memory, the Control Unit uses the Memory Address Register (MAR) to specify the memory location and the Memory Data Register (MDR) to hold the data.</li>
                            <li>The ALU performs the arithmetic or logical operation on the data in the registers.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Write Back:</strong> The result of the execution is written back to a register or main memory. The Control Unit determines where the result should be stored.</li>
                    <li>The process repeats, starting from step 1 (Fetch), for the next instruction.</li>

                Explain the working of an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
                    An <strong>Internet Service Provider (ISP)</strong> is a company or organization that provides individuals and other organizations with access to the Internet.  ISPs act as intermediaries, connecting users to the vast network of the internet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Types of ISPs:</strong>  ISPs use various technologies to deliver internet access to their customers.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dial-up:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Uses traditional telephone lines to establish a connection.</li>
                            <li>Slow data transfer speeds (up to 56 kbps).</li>

                    <li><strong>Broadband:</strong> High-speed internet access that is always on.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):</strong> Uses existing telephone lines but transmits data at higher frequencies than voice calls.
                                <p>Example:  ADSL, VDSL.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Cable:</strong> Uses the same coaxial cables that deliver cable television.
                                 <p>Example:  Comcast Xfinity, Spectrum.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Fiber:</strong> Transmits data through thin glass or plastic fibers using light signals, providing extremely high speeds.
                                 <p>Example:  Verizon FiOS, Google Fiber.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wireless:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Wi-Fi:</strong> Provides internet access within a limited range using radio waves.

                </div>

                <p>
                    <strong>How ISPs Work:</strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>User Connection:</strong> A user connects their device (computer, smartphone, etc.) to the ISP's network. This connection can be wired (e.g., Ethernet cable, DSL line) or wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular).  A modem or router is often used to facilitate this connection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> The ISP verifies the user's credentials (username and password, or other authentication methods) to ensure they are an authorized subscriber.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Downstream:</strong> When a user requests data (e.g., loads a web page), the request is sent from their device to the ISP's servers. The ISP then forwards this request to the appropriate server on the internet.  The server sends the requested data back to the ISP, which then transmits it to the user's device.</li>
                            <li><strong>Upstream:</strong> When a user sends data (e.g., sends an email, uploads a file), the data is transmitted from their device to the ISP's servers, which then route it to its destination on the internet.</li>
                         </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>IP Addressing:</strong> The ISP assigns an IP address to the user's device, allowing it to communicate with other devices and servers on the internet.  This IP address can be static (permanent) or dynamic (assigned temporarily).</li>
                    <li><strong>Routing:</strong> The ISP uses routers to direct data packets between the user's network and the broader internet.  Routers examine the destination IP address of each packet and forward it along the most efficient path.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Infrastructure:</strong> ISPs maintain a complex network infrastructure, including high-bandwidth connections, servers, routers, and other equipment, to ensure reliable and high-speed internet access.  They connect to larger networks, including Tier 1 providers, to exchange internet traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Services:</strong>  ISPs provide various services, including internet access, email accounts, web hosting, and other related services.</li>

            <div class="accordion-button">
                What is FTP? Explain with an example.
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
                    <strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</strong> is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a TCP/IP network, such as the Internet.  It is designed for transferring files efficiently and reliably.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>How FTP Works:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    FTP establishes two separate connections between the client and the server:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Control Connection (Port 21):</strong> Used for sending commands and receiving responses, such as login information, directory navigation, and file transfer requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Connection (Port 20, or dynamically assigned ports):</strong> Used for the actual transfer of file data.  This connection can be established in either active or passive mode.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    FTP involves two main components:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>FTP Client:</strong> A software application installed on the user's computer that initiates the connection to the FTP server, sends commands, and receives files.
                        <p>Examples: FileZilla, Cyberduck, command-line FTP client.</p>
                     </li>
                    <li><strong>FTP Server:</strong> A server that runs FTP server software and stores the files that clients can access.  It listens for connection requests from clients and responds to their commands.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Step-by-Step Example of Uploading a File using FTP (using an FTP client like FileZilla):</strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Open FTP Client:</strong> The user opens their FTP client software (e.g., FileZilla).</li>
                    <li><strong>Enter Connection Details:</strong> The user enters the following information to connect to the FTP server:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Host/Server:</strong> The domain name or IP address of the FTP server (e.g., ftp.example.com, 192.168.1.100).</li>
                            <li><strong>Username:</strong> The username for the FTP account on the server.</li>
                            <li><strong>Password:</strong> The password for the FTP account.</li>
                            <li><strong>Port:</strong> The port number (usually 21 for the control connection).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Establish Connection:</strong> The FTP client sends a connection request to the FTP server. The server authenticates the user using the provided username and password.</li>
                    <li><strong>Navigate Local and Remote Directories:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The FTP client displays two panels: one showing the local file system on the user's computer and the other showing the file system on the FTP server.</li>
                            <li>The user navigates to the directory on their local computer where the file to be uploaded is located.</li>
                            <li>The user navigates to the directory on the FTP server where the file should be uploaded.</li>
                         </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Initiate Upload:</strong> The user selects the file to be uploaded from their local file system and clicks an "Upload" button or drags and drops the file to the server directory panel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transfer Data:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The FTP client sends a command to the FTP server to initiate the file transfer.</li>
                            <li>The FTP client establishes a data connection with the FTP server.</li>
                            <li>The FTP client sends the file data to the FTP server over the data connection.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Server Receives and Stores File:</strong> The FTP server receives the file data and stores it in the specified directory on its file system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transfer Confirmation:</strong> The FTP server sends a confirmation message to the FTP client indicating that the file has been successfully uploaded.</li>
                    <li><strong>Close Connection:</strong> The user closes the FTP connection in the FTP client.  This closes both the control and data connections.</li>
                </ol>
