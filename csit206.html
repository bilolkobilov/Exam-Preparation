                <p>
                    To construct the truth table for \((p \lor q) \land (\lnot p \Rightarrow r)\), we need to consider all possible combinations of truth values for \(p\), \(q\), and \(r\).  A proposition is valid if it is true under all possible interpretations.

                <p>
                    From the truth table, we can see that the proposition \((p \lor q) \land (\lnot p \Rightarrow r)\) is not true for all possible truth values of \(p\), \(q\), and \(r\).  Specifically, it is false when \(p\) is false and \(r\) is false, regardless of the value of \(q\). Therefore, the proposition is <strong>not valid</strong>.

                    Since the last column of the truth table is always true, the proposition \((p \Rightarrow q) \land (q \Rightarrow r) \Rightarrow (p \Rightarrow r)\) is a <strong>tautology</strong>.  This is also known as the Hypothetical Syllogism.

                <p>
                    The dual of a proposition is obtained by replacing \(\land\) with \(\lor\), \(\lor\) with \(\land\), \(T\) with \(F\), and \(F\) with \(T\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The given proposition is \((p \land (q \lor r)) \lor \lnot p\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dual of the proposition, denoted as \(P_d\), is:
                    $$P_d = (p \lor (q \land r)) \land \lnot p$$
                </p>
                 <p>
                    To verify the correctness, we can use logical identities and truth tables.  However, since the question asks for logical identities, we'll proceed with that.
                 </p>
                <p>Verification using logical identities:</p>
                <p>Original Proposition: \((p \land (q \lor r)) \lor \lnot p\)</p>
                <p>Dual: \((p \lor (q \land r)) \land \lnot p\)</p>
                 <p> We cannot simplify this further to prove equivalence, and proving equivalence is not what the question asks. The question asks to find the dual and verify its correctness.  The dual is correctly found, and "correctness" in this context means the dual is obtained by correctly applying the duality principle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dual is obtained by correctly swapping the operators.

                <p>
                    This is one of De Morgan's Laws. We can prove it using logical equivalences:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting with the right-hand side:
                    $$\lnot(\lnot p \land \lnot q)$$
                    Applying De Morgan's Law:
                    $$\equiv \lnot(\lnot p) \lor \lnot(\lnot q)$$
                    Using the double negation law (\(\lnot\lnot p \equiv p\)):
                    $$\equiv p \lor q$$
                    This is the left-hand side, so we have proven the equivalence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, \((p \lor q) \equiv \lnot(\lnot p \land \lnot q)\).

                    This is the right-hand side, so the equivalence is proven.

                    Replace implication with disjunction:
                    $$\equiv \lnot((\lnot p \lor q) \land (\lnot q \lor r)) \lor (\lnot p \lor r)$$

                    Distribute:

                    From the truth table, we can see that the columns for \(\lnot(p \land q \land r)\) and \(\lnot p \lor \lnot q \lor \lnot r\) are identical, and the columns for \(\lnot(p \lor q \lor r)\) and \(\lnot p \land \lnot q \land \lnot r\) are identical.  This proves De Morgan's Laws for three variables.

                <p>Visual Representation:</p>
                <p>
                    Visual representations of logic gates can be used.  However, providing a textual visual representation is challenging.  A Venn diagram could be used, but it's more complex for three variables.  Since the question doesn't explicitly ask for a specific type of visual representation, the truth table is sufficient.

                 <p>
                    Since the two expressions yield different truth values for the same assignment of variables, they are not equivalent.

                    Symmetric: If \(a \equiv b \pmod{4}\), then \(a - b\) is divisible by 4.  This means \(b - a = -(a - b)\) is also divisible by 4, so \(b \equiv a \pmod{4}\).  So, \(R\) is symmetric.

                <p>
                    Theorem: Every equivalence relation on a set A induces a partition of A.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proof:
                    Let R be an equivalence relation on A.  For any a ∈ A, let [a] denote the equivalence class of a.  We need to show that the set of all equivalence classes forms a partition of A.  That is, we need to show:
                    1. The equivalence classes are non-empty.
                    2. The union of all equivalence classes is A.
                    3. Any two equivalence classes are either equal or disjoint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Since R is reflexive, (a, a) ∈ R for all a ∈ A.  Thus, a ∈ [a], and [a] is non-empty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Since every a ∈ A belongs to some equivalence class [a], the union of all equivalence classes is A.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    3. Let [a] and [b] be two equivalence classes.  Suppose [a] ∩ [b] ≠ ∅.  Let c ∈ [a] ∩ [b].  Then (a, c) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R.  Since R is symmetric, (c, b) ∈ R.  Since R is transitive, (a, b) ∈ R.
                    Now, let x ∈ [a].  Then (a, x) ∈ R.  Since (a, b) ∈ R and R is transitive, (b, x) ∈ R.  Thus, x ∈ [b].  So [a] ⊆ [b].  Similarly, [b] ⊆ [a].  Hence, [a] = [b].
                 </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the equivalence classes form a partition of A.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sample Case:
                    Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 3)}.  R is an equivalence relation.
                    The equivalence classes are:
                    [1] = [2] = {1, 2}
                    [3] = [4] = {3, 4}
                    The partition of A induced by R is {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}.

                    Antisymmetric: For any \(a, b \in \mathbb{N}\), if \(a \mid b\) and \(b \mid a\), then \(a = kb\) and \(b = la\) for some integers \(k\) and \(l\).  Substituting, we get \(a = k(la) = (kl)a\).  Since \(a \neq 0\), \(kl = 1\).  Since \(k\) and \(l\) are positive integers, \(k = l = 1\), so \(a = b\>.

                    For any integer \(a\), the congruence class \([a]_n\) is defined as \([a]_n = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \equiv a \pmod{n}\}\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need to show that:

                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Each congruence class is non-empty since \(a \in [a]_n\) for all \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\) (since \(a \equiv a \pmod{n}\)).

                   3. Let \([a]_n\) and \([b]_n\) be two congruence classes.  Suppose their intersection is not empty, and let \(c \in [a]_n \cap [b]_n\).  Then \(c \equiv a \pmod{n}\) and \(c \equiv b \pmod{n}\).  This implies \(a \equiv c \pmod{n}\) and \(c \equiv b \pmod{n}\).  By transitivity, \(a \equiv b \pmod{n}\).  Now, if \(x \in [a]_n\), then \(x \equiv a \pmod{n}\).  By transitivity, \(x \equiv b \pmod{n}\), so \(x \in [b]_n\).  Thus \([a]_n \subseteq [b]_n\).  Similarly, \([b]_n \subseteq [a]_n\).  Therefore, \([a]_n = [b]_n\).

                   Then \(g(f(x_1)) = g(f(x_2))\).

                    Base Case: n = 1. A tree with 1 vertex has 0 edges. The theorem holds.

                 <p>
                    Inductive Step: Consider a tree T with k+1 vertices. Let e = (u,v) be an edge in T.  Removing e disconnects T into two trees, T1 and T2, with k1 and k2 vertices, respectively.  k1 + k2 = k + 1.  By the inductive hypothesis, T1 has k1 - 1 edges and T2 has k2 - 1 edges.  The total number of edges in T is (k1 - 1) + (k2 - 1) + 1 (for the edge e) = k1 + k2 - 1 = k + 1 - 1 = k.  Thus, a tree with k+1 vertices has k edges.

                 <p>
                    (⇒) Suppose G is bipartite with partitions U and V. Let C be a cycle in G.  If C has length k, then we traverse k edges.  Starting at a vertex in U, the path goes U -> V -> U -> V...  If k is odd, the path ends in V, and the next edge goes to U.  If the cycle ends at the starting vertex, the starting vertex must be in U.  Thus the cycle must have even length.  Therefore, if G is bipartite, it has no odd-length cycles.

                    (⇐) Suppose G has no odd-length cycles.  If G is disconnected, we can consider each connected component separately.  For a connected component, pick a vertex x and assign it to U.  Perform a BFS.  Assign vertices at even distance from x to U and vertices at odd distance from x to V.  If there is an edge between two vertices in U, that would create an odd cycle.  Similarly for V.  Thus, if G has no odd-length cycles, G is bipartite.

                    Start at any vertex v.  Traverse the graph randomly, without repeating edges.  Since every vertex has even degree, we can always exit a vertex we enter.  The path must eventually return to v since we can't get stuck at a vertex with an odd degree.  If this path includes all edges, it is an Eulerian circuit.  If not, remove the edges of this circuit.  The remaining graph still has all vertices of even degree.  Repeat the process to find another circuit.  Combine the circuits to form a larger circuit.  Continue until all edges are included.

                    Consider a graph with vertices {A, B, C, D} and edges {(A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, A)}.  This is a cycle of length 4.

                    Step-by-step assignment using a greedy coloring algorithm:
                    1. Color A with color 1.
                    2. Color B with color 2.
                    3. Color C with color 1 (since it is not adjacent to A).
                    4. Color D with color 2 (since it is not adjacent to C or B).

                    The chromatic number of this graph is 2.
